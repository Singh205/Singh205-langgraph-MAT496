Video 1:In LangGraph, the state schema basically defines how data is structured and passed between different parts of the graph. Itâ€™s like a blueprint that tells the system what information to keep, update, or share as the graph runs.

Video 2:State reducers handle how the state changes over time. They take the current state and new inputs, then decide what updates or modifications should be made before passing the state along.

Video 3:In LangGraph, you can have multiple schemas to handle different types of data or processes within the same graph. This helps keep things organized and allows different parts of the graph to work with their own structured state.
