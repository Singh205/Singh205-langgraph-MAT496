LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain that helps you build more advanced, stateful AI applications. Instead of connecting prompts in a simple chain, it lets you organize your logic as a graph—where each node can represent an action, model, or decision step, and edges define how information flows between them.

It’s designed for building complex systems like conversational agents, data-processing workflows, or autonomous tools that need memory and branching logic. LangGraph also integrates easily with LangChain, LangSmith, and major LLMs such as OpenAI or Anthropic models.

One of its key strengths is how it manages state, keeping track of information across different steps so your application can handle dynamic, multi-turn interactions.

In short, LangGraph takes you beyond basic prompt chaining and lets you design full, flexible AI systems with clear control over how each part connects and behaves.
