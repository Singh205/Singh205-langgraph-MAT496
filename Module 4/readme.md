Video 1:I learned that parallelization in LangGraph means running multiple nodes or branches at the same time instead of one after another. It helps speed up workflows by executing independent tasks simultaneously and then combining their results. This makes the graph more efficient and faster overall.

Video 2:I learned that subgraphs in LangGraph are smaller, self-contained graphs **inside a larger graph**. They help **organize complex workflows** by grouping related nodes together, making the structure cleaner and easier to manage. Subgraphs can also be **reused** across different parts of a project.

Video 3:I learned that map-reduce in LangGraph is used to handle large sets of data or tasks efficiently. The map step processes multiple chunks in parallel, and the reduce step combines their results into a final output. Itâ€™s great for speeding up workflows that involve repetitive or data-heavy operations.
