Module 1


Video 1: This notebook teaches how to build a simple conditional graph using the LangGraph framework. It explains how to define a state, create nodes as Python functions, and connect them with both normal and conditional edges. The lesson also shows how to compile and visualize the graph structure, helping users understand the basic flow and logic of state-based graphs.

Video 2: This notebook teaches how to build a simple LangChain chain that connects key components of the framework. It guides you through using chat messages as state, chat models as nodes, and tools that can be bound and executed within those nodes. Essentially, it shows how to create a structured conversational workflow — a chain — combining model reasoning, message flow, and tool interaction

Video 3: This teaches how to build a router in LangChain, where a chat model decides between giving a direct response or calling a tool based on user input. It demonstrates how an LLM can control the flow of a conversation — effectively acting as a simple agent that routes tasks intelligently depending on context.

Video 4:This notebook teaches how to create a generic agent architecture in LangChain. It builds on the router concept by allowing the model not just to call tools but to continuously loop between reasoning and acting, passing tool results back to itself until a final answer is reached. Essentially, it shows how to make a self-directed AI agent that can think, act, and respond autonomously.

Video 5: This teaches how to build an AI agent with memory using LangGraph and LangChain. It extends a basic agent that can act, observe, and reason by adding memory to retain context across interactions. The lesson shows how to define tools, connect them to an LLM, and create a reactive graph structure that uses stored information to make better decisions in later steps.
