Module 1
Video 1: This notebook teaches how to build a simple conditional graph using the LangGraph framework. It explains how to define a state, create nodes as Python functions, and connect them with both normal and conditional edges. The lesson also shows how to compile and visualize the graph structure, helping users understand the basic flow and logic of state-based graphs.
