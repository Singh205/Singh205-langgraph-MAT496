Starting langgraph module 3 
---

Video 1: What i learned is that streaming interruption in LangGraph is when an AI is generating a response in real time (like streaming text word by word), and you can stop or redirect it while it’s still talking.

It means the model doesn’t have to finish its full answer before you can interact — you can interrupt mid-stream, change the input, and have it switch to a new path or action immediately.
