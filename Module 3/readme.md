Starting langgraph module 3

Video 1: What i learned is that streaming interruption in LangGraph is when an AI is generating a response in real time (like streaming text word by word), and you can stop or redirect it while it’s still talking.

It means the model doesn’t have to finish its full answer before you can interact — you can interrupt mid-stream, change the input, and have it switch to a new path or action immediately.

Video 2: I learned that a breakpoint is like a pause point in your code when you’re debugging. You set it on a specific line, and when the program runs, it stops there so you can see what’s happening. You can check variable values and step through the code slowly to understand how it’s working.

Video 3:I came to learn edit state with human feedback means you manually change the AI’s memory or context while it’s running. Like, if the AI misunderstood something, you can edit the state to fix it or guide it better. It helps you fine-tune how the AI thinks during a conversation.

Video 4:A dynamic breakpoint is like a normal breakpoint but smarter. Instead of stopping every time, it only pauses when a certain condition is met — like when a variable hits a specific value. It helps you debug more precisely without stopping the program too often.
